/*

    This script rounds and returns the specified value to the nearest nth. 

    For instance, if you want to round a number to the nearest number divisible by 5,
    you would write the script as such.
    
    dt_nth_round( 31, 5 );
    
    The script would return 30, because it's the value closest to 30, which is the closest
    value divisble by 5.
